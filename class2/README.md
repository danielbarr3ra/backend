##Instructions

Same as class1 but using fs library and adding two more methods. These are also updated in the unit tests. Added other eslint rules as well.


## Just clone repo:
1. npm i
2. npm test
3. Additionally you can use the build command to amke sure you have typsecript installed.


I added the test metnioned should be good.
